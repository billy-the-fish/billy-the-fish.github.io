= Get started with Miro Web SDK

Miro is a fast, free, infinite, digital whiteboard that you use to ideate, strategize, organize, and collaborate with your distributed team in the cloud at any time.

You use Web SDK to create custom features in you Miro whiteboards that suite the way of working for your team. For example, you can create custom:

* Visual asset management and ensure your whiteboards have branded icons and images

* Syncronizations between Miro items with other tools using custom fields and interface

* Collaboration plugins for remote meetings, workshops and retrospectives

https://developers.miro.com/docs/web-plugins-features[Web-plugins features] shows the features you add to your custom whiteboards.

This get started shows you how to rapidly create a whiteboard customization for your team.

== Prerequisites

In order to create a custom Miro whiteboard, you must already:


* Use a browser with a developer console such as:

** Google Chrome
** FireFox

* Have a basic understanding of JavaScript and Web applications.

* https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site[A GitHub pages repository] to serve your Web SDK plugin. For example: https://billy-the-fish.github.io/.
+
If you wish to test from your local machine and not a public server, install https://github.com/http-party/http-server[http-server] to publish your page and create an https://ngrok.com/[ngrok] account to tunnel your content to a public URL.


== Create a custom date button

In order to create a custom whiteboard:

. *Create a Miro developer account*
+
In your browser, navigate to https://miro.com/signup/ and follow the setup wizard.

. *Create and test your WebApp code*
+
You use the Developer Console in your browser to test your code. To do this:

.. Open a board from Dev Console:
+
image::images/open_a_board.png[]

.. Write your Web App code:
+
This code calculates the center point of the current https://developers.miro.com/docs/board-manipulation[miro.board.viewport] instance, and writes today's date to a https://developers.miro.com/docs/interface-istickerwidget[sticker].
+
[source,javascript]
----
const viewport = await miro.board.viewport.get()

// Calculate the center of the visible view
const centeredX = viewport.x + viewport.width / 2
const centeredY = viewport.y + viewport.height / 2

// Retrieve today's date.
var today = new Date()
var dd = String(today.getDate()).padStart(2, '0');
var mm = String(today.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0'); //January is 0!
var yyyy = today.getFullYear();
today = mm + '/' + dd + '/' + yyyy;

// Create a sticker in the center of the current view
miro.board.widgets.create({type: "sticker", text: today, x:centeredX, y:centeredY})
----

.. Open the dev console for your board and paste your code into it:
+
Press enter in the Developer Console and you see your custom widget.

. *Create a Miro app*
+
A Miro App is the collection of code, resources and rights needed to publish a whiteboard to your audience. This app authenticates the URL you publish your App to.
+
To create an App:

.. In your browser, navigate to https://miro.com/app/settings/user-profile/apps.

.. Agree to the _Terms and Conditions_ and click _Create new app_.
+
image::images/create_new_app.png[]

.. In _Create App_, fill in the app information and click _Create app_.
+

.. Set _Web-plugin_ to the public URL for your Web App.
+

.. Choose the _OAuth scopes_ for your Web App.
+
In Miro, OAuth https://developers.miro.com/docs/sdk#scopes[scopes] govern the permissions and capabilities of your Web App. When you enable a scope, each user has the associated permissions.
+

+
Now you are sure that your code works, add it to the boards in your dev
Now you are sure that your code works, add it to the boards in your developer account as a Web App.

.. Install your Web App.

... Click _Install app and get OAuth token_.

... In _Install app to get OAuth token_, choose team to install your app and click _install_.

... Save the token locally, then click _Close_.
